# Coursera
These repository conteins my solutions for problems from my courses. At the moment I am going through two specializations on coursera. First about C++, and the second about ML.

## [C++ specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/c-plus-plus-modern-development)

From these specialization at the moment I have passed one course)


## [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-data-analysis)

From these specialization at the moment I have passed two courses)

Sorry for unsystematic file location in first two courses)) I haven't github when passed them.
